# ShellHelper

To run this project, cd into containing file and type in 'make' to create object files. Then type 'make run' to run the custom terminal. The included helper can be called from this terminal by typing 'helper' or 'codey'.

The Codey helper can respond to several inquiries, including requests such as finding a file or opening a browser to a desired website.

* To find a file, ask Codey find, and then the name of your file.

* To open a website, simply give him the command 'open' and then just the name of the site, for example "Open YouTube please."

* To find the date, time, or weather, simply ask him with these words.

* Be polite. Say please and thank you!

* Say good bye to leave the helper!
